            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is it for?</h3>
            <p>This bot will assign you roles based on your WvW world. You will need a GW2 account API key.</p>
            <h3>What permissions are needed?</h3>
            <p>The API key only needs accounts permissions and must include exactly <strong>wvwbot</strong> in the name (lowercase).</p>
            <h3>How does it work</h3>
            <p>This bot saves your Discord ID and one API key for that account. You can replace the key by adding a new one. You can delete all data associated with a key by using the delete button above.</p>
            <h3>I transferred to another world. What now?</h3>
            <p>Your roles update when you order a new API key, and every 24 hours. You can press 'Sync now' to do it sooner. Your roles should update.</p>
            <h3>How can I add the bot to my server?</h3>
            <p>Add the Discord bot to your server.</p>
            <h3>'Login with Discord'? Are you trying to steal my password</h3>
            <p>Don't worry. You will see the bot requests your Discord ID and list of servers, which is what Discord will return. Your password stays with you and Discord.</p>
